# conversation-merger

Many social media let users retrieve their data on demand. When it comes to messages to friends you sometimes only get your own messages, i.e. the ones you have sent to a specific user, thus you only have half the conversation.

If two users that have conversed with each other retrieve their data, i.e. we have both the halves of the conversation, it is possible to merge those. This program does that for data retrieved from a famous company.
